Downloading whole tree distributions
====================================


The phylogeny is available to download as either archives of complete trees (below) or by subsetting to a user provided set of species using the tool on the right.

There are four choices of class-wide tree distribution to choose from. 10k trees for fully resolved verions from the 10 or 1 fossil calibration scenarios, or 500 trees for data only trees from the 10 or 1 fossil calibration scenarios. Trees are stored as zip archives of 1K trees each. Full details of each tree distribution are available in the methods section and supplementary material.
