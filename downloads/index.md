Downloading whole tree distributions
====================================


The phylogeny is available to download as either archives of complete trees (below) or by subsetting to a user provided set of species using the tool on the right.

There are four choices of class-wide tree distribution to choose from. 10k trees for fully resolved verions from the 10 or 1 fossil calibration scenarios, or 500 trees for data only trees from the 10 or 1 fossil calibration scenarios. Trees are stored as zip archives of 1K trees each. Full details of each tree distribution are available in the methods section and supplementary material.

[Full trees (1192 species), 10 fossil calibration](https://data.vertlife.org/?start_folder=Stage2/)

[Genetic data only trees (610 species), 10 fossil calibration](https://data.vertlife.org/?start_folder=Stage1/)
